<h1 align="center">C</h1>

<h3 align="center">C is a very powerful and widely used language. It is used in many scientific programming situations. It forms the core of the modern languages Java and C++.</h3>

<h3 align="left"> why do we use C?</h3>

1) It was (and still is in some circumstances) the language of choice in Operating System Development (including all of Unix).
2) It allows you direct control over the very low level aspects of the computer.
3) Many legacy programs are written in C.
4) Most of the things you learn with C will be directly transferable to future programming languages.
5) Programs that are created with C run very quickly.
6) C has a syntax (and some semantics) very close to Matlab, making the transition easy (okay, easier...).
